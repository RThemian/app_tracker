# Frontend

## A React.js frontend application to be used with the app_tracker Django app.

### Install dependencies:

This project uses npm. Install npm if it is not already installed on your machine. CSS Tricks has a handy guide on how to do this:
[How To Install npm with nvm](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-install-npm-node-nvm/)

_NOTE: You may alternatively use yarn or another package manager, but your results may vary._

Using your package manager, install the frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Running the Frontend Application:

Run `npm start` and create-react-app will start the react application in your web browser.
You can view the application at [localhost:3000/](localhost:3000/). 
Create-react-app supports hot reloading, and you should be able to see changes in real time in the browser as you edit code. 


### React Developer Tools:

It is suggested to download the React Developer Tools Google Chrome extension:

# GENERIC CREATE-REACT-APP README:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
